function [ myLmat ] = BuildLmat( wordsIN, gramsIN )
%% BUILDLMAT Construct the L matrix using passed words (domians) and n-grams.
%   Constructs the L matrix by counting the number of times an n-gram 
%       (columns) appears in a given word/domain (rows).  Accepts cell 
%       arrays as inputs and outputs result as a sparse matrix.  Calls for 
%       a parallel pool of size 4 on the local machine.  This may need to 
%       be modified based on the number of available cores on the local 
%       machine.  Additionally, any existing parallel pools on the local 
%       machine should be shutdown prior to running this code.

tmpSize = size(wordsIN);
nWords = tmpSize(1,1); % number of words

tmpSize = size(gramsIN);
nGrams = tmpSize(1,1); % number of n-grams


myLmat = sparse(nWords, nGrams); % allocate sparse matrix of 0s for result.

parfor i=1:nWords

        tmpSize = strfind( wordsIN{i,1}, gramsIN{j,1} ); % stores number of 
     occurances in array

        % integer.
